**....** which I have been learning in my spare time for the last couple of months. Static Site generators are a new modern approach to webdev, enabling blazing speed by serving static content. In short no database or retrieval of information from a webserver in the traditional dynamic site scenario which makes the site very snappy indeed.

Creating content is very easy and uses the very friendly / popular markdown syntax i.e .md files, this means you can write content like I am write now in my code editor, build it and deploy it using a git workflow which obviously comes with its own benefits around vesion control. 

We are also taking advantage of hosting this very simple site using Github pages, it's free and in many ways a perfect pairing. Not having to maintain a webserver (Which I unfortunately also do for some other assets, its one less nix server I need to worry about with a two year old taking up most of my free non working hours... not that I am complaining. **Dad life rocks.**)
